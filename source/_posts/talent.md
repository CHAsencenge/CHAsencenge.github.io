<blockquote class="blockquote-center">when someone beats you easily by talent, can u always keep uncompromising?</blockquote>

<--!more-->

A new teacher join in real dance studio lately.  
How do u feel if someone easily beats u by his or her talent? Can you keep uncompromising and avoid being affected? Are u strong enough?  
I'm not strong enough, cuz I feel down when I saw this artical. It's the same that we both started to dance from 2015, but 2017 Hong became battle guest in hip-hop compitition, and continuously steped foward.  
Why I'm not so talent in everything? I think.  
I paid all my four years of undergraduate into dance, but I gained nothing, nothing I can prove myself, even I exactly can't prove myself cuz I clearly know my weakness.  
Then I began to doubt  what I strive for, and what can I strive for. I lost my four years, lost my schoolwork, lost my friendship, and lost my 'once' precious memories.  
I comfort myself, at lease I became strong, so I have nothing to be afriad. 
But now I find, I gain nothing but lonely and weakness.  
Hope u will not be afraid of this thing - losing.  
But still be aspirant, keep going.  
You can't do the best, if u don't want then just deny this fact, but don't always be affected by your mediocre.  
Focus on ur own shit.
